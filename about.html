    <h2>What is our story?</h2>
    <p>Meet 3 third year Warwick students who have mastered where to go on campus for the best coffee. Browse our website for all your coffee needs and thank us later!
    We have given each coffee shop a rating out of 5 on three different categories:<br>
       - <strong>Coffee Quality</strong>- how good the coffee <i>really</i> is! How does it taste? Is it always the right temperature?<br>
      - <strong>Ambience</strong> - what it's like inside the cafe. Is it aesthetically pleasing (read: good for Instagram)? Is it warm? Are there enough places to sit?<br>
      - <strong>Speed</strong> - how quickly you go from order to sipping that sweet, caffeine-y goodness.<br>
